# SimpleMessages

Simple bidirectional JSON message channels using net sockets.

## Installation

Via npm on Node:

```
npm install simplemessages
```

Reference it from your program:

```js
var simplemessages = require('simplemessages');
```

## Usage

Server side

```js
var server = simplemessages.createServer(function(channel) {
	channel.on('message', function(msg) {
		// each message process here
	});
});

server.listen(8000);
```

Sending a message (any Javascript value that can be processed by JSON.stringify

```js
server.write(msg);
```

Client side, you specify port, host and, optionally, a callback on connect event:

```js
var client = simplemessages.createClient(port, host, function() {
    // code to run at connect event
	client.write({ name: "my message" });
	// use client.write(msg) to send a message to the server	
	// when done, close the client channel
	client.end();
});
```

Alternatively, you can use a socket, and listen on it for connect event.
```js
var socket = net.connect(port, host);
var client = simplemessages.createClient(socket);

// Launch on socket connect
socket.on('connect', function() {
	client.write({ name: "my message" });
	// use client.write(msg) to send a message to the server
	
	// when done, close the client channel
	client.end();
});

```
